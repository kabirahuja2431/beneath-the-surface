# Beneath the Surface Environments

This repository contains the open-source implementations of several environments
from the paper *Beneath the Surface*: Investigating LLMs' Capabilities for
Communicating with Subtext.

## Installation

This repository was tested on Python 3.13. We recommend setting up a virtual
environment using `venv`

```bash
python3 -m venv subtextenv
source subtextenv/bin/activate
```

You can install all the required packages as follows:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## API keys setup

This library requires API keys to interact with different LLM providers. You
need to set up your keys as environment variables:

```bash
# OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Anthropic API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"

# Google API key
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"

# Mistral API key
export MISTRAL_API_KEY="your-mistral-api-key"
```

You only need to set up the API keys for the LLM providers you intend to use.
For example, if you're only running game plays that involve Gemini models, you
only need to set up the `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

### Getting Tell Me A Story Data

Our shared context experiments use stories from
[Tell Me A Story](https://github.com/google-deepmind/tell_me_a_story) Dataset.

## Running Experiments

### Visual Allusions

**Base Case (No Shared Context)**
```bash
python -m subtext_bench.visual_allusions.main -c "configs/visual_allusions/experiments.json" -e "4p_all_llm"
```

**Running With Shared Context Between 2 Players**
```bash
python -m subtext_bench.visual_allusions.main -c "configs/visual_allusions/experiments.json" -e "4p_2p_shared_context"
```

You can edit [configs/visual_allusions/experiments.json](configs/visual_allusions/experiments.json) to
try out different setups.

## The Aesopian Author

```bash
python -m subtext_bench.aesopian_author.main -c configs/aesopian_author/experiments.json -e flash_author_pro_critic_inquisitor_lh
```

You can edit [configs/aesopian_author/experiments.json](configs/aesopian_author/experiments.json) to try
out different setups.
